On an Invoice, the CONFIRM button automatically generates an invoice on
the InvoiceXpress service.

The "Email InvoiceXpress" button requests the InvoiceXpress service to
send an email with a copy of the legal document.

The Invoice form shows an "InvoiceXpress" tab containing details for the
corresponding InvoiceXpress document.
