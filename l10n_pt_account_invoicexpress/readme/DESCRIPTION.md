Generate Portuguese tax authority legal Invoices ("Faturas") using
InvoiceXpress.


InvoiceXpress is a paid service. Visit <https://invoicexpress.com> for
more details.

Once the InvoiceXpress connection is configured, the invoice CONFIRM
button automatically generates the InvoiceXpress invoice.

If the InvoiceXpress Invoice email template is configured, the
InvoiceXpress service will also send the invoice by email, using the
details in Odoo configured email template.

This replaces the Odoo SEND & PRINT button, since only the InvoiceXpress
generated document should be used. Having other print layouts for the
invoice is not allowed by the Portuguese Tax Authority.

Legal transport documents ("Guias de Transporte" e "Guias de Remessa)
are also supported through an extension module. For this please ensure that
"l10n_pt_stock_invoicexpress" is installed.
